        <p>Neil Armstrong: Born on August 5, 1930, Neil Armstrong was a naval aviator, test pilot, and aerospace engineer. Before Apollo 11, he flew on the Gemini 8 mission, showcasing his skill and composure. As the mission commander, Armstrong was the first human to walk on the moon. His calm demeanor and precise piloting during the lunar landing were crucial to the mission's success. Post-mission, Armstrong continued to inspire through his work in academia and public service.</p>

        <p>Buzz Aldrin: Buzz Aldrin, born on January 20, 1930, was a mechanical engineer and astronaut. Aldrin's pioneering work in orbital mechanics earned him a spot on the Gemini 12 mission, where he perfected spacewalk techniques. As the Lunar Module pilot, Aldrin followed Armstrong onto the moon, contributing significantly to the mission's scientific objectives. Known for his outspoken advocacy for space exploration, Aldrin remains a prominent figure in the aerospace community.</p>

        <p>Michael Collins: Michael Collins, born on October 31, 1930, served as the Command Module pilot. Although he did not walk on the moon, his role was critical. Collins' expert piloting and support ensured the Command Module Columbia remained in perfect orbit, ready for Armstrong and Aldrin's return. After Apollo 11, Collins continued to influence space policy and education, serving as the director of the National Air and Space Museum.</p>
